# 🍽️ MealMate

MealMate is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built to help students at the University of South Carolina easily track their weekly meal plan swipes.  
It works on desktop and mobile, can be installed on iPhones via “Add to Home Screen,” and functions completely offline using Workbox caching.

## Future Plans

This version of MealMate is a testing version. I will further implement automation of the tracking so you don't have to adjust the mealswipes yourself.
That was the original goal of this project. The buttons are temporary. There will be a setting to turn off automation and use the buttons however they are currently for testing as of now.
